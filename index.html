<p>This is a page for my website planning and today I would like to share my ideas for a website. Firstly i need to find someone who needs a website for their work or school purposes just like us, after i find someone that needs a website i could talk to them and see what kind of website they want because at the end of the day it all depends on the customer who would usually pay me for the website but not in this case. Or i can find someone who already has a website and help them improve on it which would be really beneficial for both the parties because firstly I would have to work a bit less at least I dont have to start with the basics and secondly my customer can get his website done from two different set of people which should make his website look better. Or i can find a kind of topic or interest thatI like or is trending these days and make a website about that which would be pretty. Right now I am probably going to edit my dad's website for his work which was made by my brother himself so getting his help and talking to him about new ideas could benefit him and me which is exactly we both want is to get a better website from helping each other out. Or i could make an entirely new website about LeBron James or something that really intesrests me like gaming</p>
